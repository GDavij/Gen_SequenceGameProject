<h2>Infos Basic{</h2>
<h3>So this is a game where u need to get the reference that every round it goes higher, and send it to the game, if u got, the game gets harder , else u lose</h3> 
<h2>}</h2>
<h2>why do i done that{</h2>
    <h3>i done that cause i really would like to Code a Game and by what i saw deppending of whose game it is "Easy" then i think on one, and this was a good ideia to code, so i Code it 
    it was good to cause then i could train SetTimeOut / SetInterval as Much as ClassList on HTML-Elements and keyFrames 
    and how to do an Relative Distances, Widths and Heights
    it still doesn't have any sound on it maybe it will in a future time.
    Now it Does Has Acessibility for SmartPhones \(^_^)/ </h3>
