Infos Basic{
So this is a game where u need to get the reference that every round it goes higher, and send it to the game, if u got the game gets harder , else u lose 
}
why do i done that{
    i done that cause i really would like to Code a Game and by what i saw deppending of whosse game it is "Easy" then i think and this was a good ideia to code, so i Code it 
    it was good to cause then i could train SetTimeOut / SetInterval as Much as ClassList on Elements and keyFrames 
    and how to do an Relative Distances, Widths and Heights
    it still doesn't have any sound on it maybe it will in a future time
    it can't runs on SmartPhones
