<h2>Infos Basic{</h2>
<h3>So this is a game where u need to get the reference that every round it goes higher, and send it to the game, if u got the game gets harder , else u lose</h3> 
<h2>}</h2>
<h2>why do i done that{</h2>
    <h3>i done that cause i really would like to Code a Game and by what i saw deppending of whosse game it is "Easy" then i think and this was a good ideia to code, so i Code it 
    it was good to cause then i could train SetTimeOut / SetInterval as Much as ClassList on Elements and keyFrames 
    and how to do an Relative Distances, Widths and Heights
    it still doesn't have any sound on it maybe it will in a future time
    it Probaly runs with minimal of acessiblity for SmartPhones NOW </h3>

    <h2>Basic Info of the Game{</h2>
        <h3>This game i s on an Exprerimental Beta Test.
        as i say Expreremental i would like to say that it have some problems with the timming of CSS 'Animations' with the JS Script on some codes but by what it fells and know bugs just one can maybe make your gamble bad unfortunately.
        i tried to fix it scripting an 'SetTimeOut' of 500ms but i'm not sure if it fixed completed it </h3>
